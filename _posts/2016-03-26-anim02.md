Our next animation uses a gridded topography for parts of Colorado (US);
the file is distributed with the tutorial examples. Here, we want to use
:doc:`grdimage </grdimage>` to generate a shaded-relief
image sequence in which we sweep the illumination azimuth around the
entire horizon. The resulting animation illustrates how changing the
illumination azimuth can bring out subtle features (or artifacts) in the
gridded data. The red arrow points in the direction of the illumination.
