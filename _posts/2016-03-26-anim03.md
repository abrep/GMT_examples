Our third animation keeps a fixed gridded data set but moves the camera
angle around the full 360. We use
:doc:`grdview </grdview>` to generate a shaded-relief
image sequence using the new enhanced **-E** option. No additional
information is plotted on the image. As before we produce an animated
GIF image.

{% highlight bash %}
{% include {{page.script}} %}
{% endhighlight %}

![]({{ page.id }}/{{ page.figure }})
