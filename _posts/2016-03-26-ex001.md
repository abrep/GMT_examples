We want to create two contour maps of the low order geoid using the
Hammer equal area projection. Our gridded data file is called `osu91a1f_16.nc` and
contains a global 1 by 1 gridded geoid. We would like to show one map centered on Greenwich and
one centered on the dateline. Positive contours should be drawn with a
solid pen and negative contours with a dashed pen. Annotations should
occur for every 50 m contour level, and both contour maps should show
the continents in light brown in the background. Finally, we want a
rectangular frame surrounding the two maps. This is how it is done:

{% highlight bash %}
{% include {{page.script}} %}
{% endhighlight %}

The first command draws a box surrounding the maps. This is followed by
two sequences of `pscoast`, `grdcontour`,
`grdcontour`. They differ in that the
first is centered on Greenwich; the second on the dateline. We use the
limit option (**-L**) in `grdcontour`
to select negative contours only and plot those with a dashed pen, then
positive contours only and draw with a solid pen [Default]. The **-T**
option causes tick marks pointing in the downhill direction to be drawn
on the innermost, closed contours. For the upper panel we also added -
and + to the local lows and highs. You can find this illustration as

![]({{ page.id }}/{{ page.figure }})
