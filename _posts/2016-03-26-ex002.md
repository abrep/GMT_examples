As our second example we will demonstrate how to make color images from
gridded data sets
The region of interest is the Hawaiian islands, and due to
the oblique trend of the island chain we prefer to rotate our
geographical data sets using an oblique Mercator projection defined by
the hotspot pole at (68W, 69N). We choose the point (190, 25.5) to be
the center of our projection (e.g., the local origin), and we want to
image a rectangular region defined by the longitudes and latitudes of
the lower left and upper right corner of region. In our case we choose
(160, 20) and (220, 30) as the corners. We use
`grdimage` to make the illustration:

{% highlight bash %}
{% include {{page.script}} %}
{% endhighlight %}

We use
`makecpt` to generate a linear color
palette file `geoid.cpt` for the geoid and use
`grd2cpt` to get a histogram-equalized
CPT file `topo.cpt` for the topography data. To emphasize the structures in the
data we calculate the slopes in the north-south direction using
`grdgradient`; these will be used to
modulate the color image. Next we run
`grdimage` to create a color-code image
of the Geosat geoid heights, and draw a color legend to the right of the
image with `psscale`. Similarly, we run
`grdimage` but specify **-Y**\ 4.5i to
plot above the previous image. Adding scale and label the two plots a)
and b) completes the illustration.
