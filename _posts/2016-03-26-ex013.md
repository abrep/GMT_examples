In many areas, such as fluid dynamics and elasticity, it is desirable to
plot vector fields of various kinds. GMT provides a way to illustrate
2-component vector fields using the
:doc:`grdvector </grdvector>` utility. The two
components of the field (Cartesian or polar components) are stored in
separate grid files. In this example we use
:doc:`grdmath </grdmath>` to generate a surface
:math:`z(x, y) = x \cdot \exp(-x^2 -y^2)` and to calculate
:math:`\nabla z` by returning the *x*- and *y*-derivatives separately.
We superpose the gradient vector field and the surface *z* and also plot
the components of the gradient in separate windows. A
:doc:`pstext </pstext>` call to place a header finishes the plot
