This example demonstrates how :doc:`pscoast </pscoast>`
can be used to set up clip paths based on coastlines. This approach is
well suited when different gridded data sets are to be merged on a plot
using different CPT files. Merging the files themselves may
not be doable since they may represent different data sets, as we show
in this example. Here, we lay down a color map of the geoid field near
India with :doc:`grdimage </grdimage>`, use
:doc:`pscoast </pscoast>` to set up land clip paths, and
then overlay topography from the ETOPO5 data set with another call to
:doc:`grdimage </grdimage>`. We finally undo the
clippath with a second call to :doc:`pscoast </pscoast>`
with the option **-Q** (Figure [fig:example:sub:`1`\ 7]):

We also plot a color legend on top of the land. So here we basically
have three layers of "paint" stacked on top of each other: the
underlaying geoid map, the land mask, and finally the color legend. This
legend makes clear how :doc:`grd2cpt </grd2cpt>`
distributed the colors over the range: they are not of equal length put
are associated with equal amounts of area in the plot. Since the high
amounts (in red) are not very prevalent, that color spans a long range.

For this image it is appropriate to use the **-I** option in
:doc:`psscale </psscale>` so the legend gets shaded,
similar to the geoid grid. See Appendix [app:M] to learn more about
CPT files and ways to draw color legends.
