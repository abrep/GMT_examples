The main purpose of this script is not to show how to plot a
map background and a few circles, but rather demonstrate how a map
legend may be composed using the new tool
:doc:`pslegend </pslegend>`. Some scripting is used to
pull out information from the data file that is later used in the
legend. The legend will normally have the email address of the script
owner; here that command is commented out and the user is hardwired to
"GMT guru". The USGS logo, taken from their web page and converted to a
Sun raster file, is used to spice up the legend.

The script produces the plot in Figure,
giving the URL where these and similar data can be obtained.
