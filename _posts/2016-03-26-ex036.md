The next script produces the plot in Figure. Here
we demonstrate how :doc:`sphinterpolate </sphinterpolate>` can be used
to perform spherical gridding.  Our example uses early measurements of
the radius of Mars from Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter spacecrafts.  The
middle panels shows the data distribution while the top and bottom panel
are images of the interpolation using a piecewise linear interpolation
and a smoothed spline interpolation, respectively.  For spherical gridding
with large volumes of data we recommend :doc:`sphinterpolate </sphinterpolate>`
while for small data sets (such as this one, actually) you have more flexibility
with :doc:`greenspline </greenspline>`.
