In this example show how the two modules :doc:`psbasemap </psbasemap>`
and :doc:`mapproject </mapproject>` can be used
to place map inserts on top of your map.  The map insert is usually
intended for placing a smaller-scale version of the larger geographical
context of your main plot, so that reader unfamiliar with the detailed
map can see what region we are looking at.  While the Australia example
is simplest since we know the insert will be a square map, the Spain
example requires us to compute the dimensions of the insert first, via
:doc:`mapproject </mapproject>`, so that we can determine exact insert dimensions.
